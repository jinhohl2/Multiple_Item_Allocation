## Purposes:
- 1. Implement integer programming, linear optimization for convex probrem, and two rounding algorithms
- 2. Apply rounding algorithms to the continuous solution of convex programming and generate plots of objective values of different methods
- 3. Compare performances of two rounding algorithms with the classic integer programming
- 4. Implemment randomized descent method and compare its performance with the integer programming
